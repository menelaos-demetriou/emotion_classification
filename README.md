# emotion_classification
Dataset was taken from https://github.com/muxspace/facial_expressions.  
This repo contains the code to train a CNN for emotion detection. Currently accuracy on test set is 100%.  
The model is overfitting so extra work needed to examine training performance with test performance 
plus reduce complexity of the model.

# Further improvements
1. Add customized metrics  
2. Data Augmentation  
3. Confusion matrix  
4. Gridsearch    
5. Visualise CNN output  
6. Fix loss plot
